## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Working through this project continued to engrain the Frontend Mentor process as well as further build upon my HTML & CSS skills.

I took to opportunity to implement CSS clamp(), which is a feature that I have struggled to wrap my head around. I also utilized transition for the hover effect.

### Continued development

I wan to continue to further my understanding of additional CSS features and animations.

### Useful resources

- [CSS Clamp Article](https://css-tricks.com/linearly-scale-font-size-with-css-clamp-based-on-the-viewport/) - This article explained clamp in a clear way for me and how to calculate the growth value.
